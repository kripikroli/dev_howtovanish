<p><strong>[pullquote]You can create data disruption through the layers of information.[/pullquote]</strong>With growing <a title="domestic security measures" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/domestic-security-measures/">domestic security measures</a> there are various areas of citizen privacy that get crosschecked like with the <a title="sexually assaultive tsa" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/do-you-need-to-sue-a-tsa-agent/" target="_blank">sexually assaultive TSA</a>. Often crossing points and co-mingling of measures hampers privacy through the changing civil, political and <a title="privacy rights for americans" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/05/privacy-rights-for-americans" target="_blank">privacy rights for Americans</a>. Thus, proactive protection measures must be taken and you can create data disruption through the layers of information.</p>
<p>While I would not rely on it, there can still be directives and responsible participation from government bodies and authority figures that work towards bringing the protective laws which can help maintain the dignity and privacy of individuals. Privacy is often associated with <a title="public anonymity" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/public-anonymity-decline-peace-officer/" target="_blank">public anonymity</a> and is a fundamental human right which needs to be brought to everyone's attention for the greater good of all.</p>
<p>Absolute privacy, if it would lead to deal-breaking status, does not need to be maintained by individuals in order to participate in commerce. There is a sensible <a title="privacy equation" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/privacy-equation/" target="_blank">privacy equation</a> you can apply. But if your data and information is stored in a <a title="transactional database" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/transactional-databases-what-me-worry/" target="_blank">transactional database</a>, archived and searchable for the rest of your life then perhaps you may want to take greater control over what appears.</p>
<p>You may want to <a title="raw food recipes" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/08/taking-raw-food-recipes-underground/" target="_blank">cook with raw food</a>, buy creative literature from Amazon or some other victimless activity. But those may be made illegal, either now or in the future, and have a record of such in your transactions could be particularly dangerous. Plus, since the moves of an individual can be tapped and tracked then it is not all too crazy to take proactive measures to protect yourself from a control freak nation or paranoid culture that is scared of its own shadow.</p>

<p>Many innocent people have gone through tortures and harassment in the name of domestic security measures. They were never involved with any incident that damaged the public peace. Yet some overzealous politically compromised official decided to harass and harm someone by using the State's police power.</p>
<p>This leads to lives being disrupted, individuals being harassed and tracked while public resources are wasted and the overall protection level for the general public is decreased. This is one reason why you need to take control of your privacy and protect yourself from some costumed criminal gang member. And to start you will want to be sure to control your Internet privacy whenever possible</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The legal environment in many countries is constantly changing and often eroding privacy protections. Busybodies are a constant threat to your personal safety and financial wealth. But you can take control of your privacy, increase public anonymity and protect yourself.</p>
<p>The hampering of real authority of the individual, as opposed to the wasteful domestic security measures and regulations, in <a title="privacy policies" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/06/company-privacy-policies">terms of privacy</a> and harassment is becoming a significant threat. But there are strategies and tactics you can employ to increase the peace and securing privacy. Start with decreasing the amount of financial data and information you leave scattered around.
