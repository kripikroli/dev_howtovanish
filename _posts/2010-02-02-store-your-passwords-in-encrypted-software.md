<p>When you first start surfing the Internet you will come across many sites that ask for you to signup. They may ask you for a quick, two second signup that consist of your password and email address. Or they may decide to ask you for a whole ton of extra information including your real name, home address, phone number, and other unique items that will easily identify you.</p>
<p>You will not join every site that asks you for this information but you will join enough that you soon will have an overabundance of passwords to remember.This is when people usually get lazy and start to use the same password at every site. This is a bad idea and there is software that can help you store your different passwords while at the same time keeping them safe, secure and encrypted.</p>
<p>If you use the same password on every site then what happens if one site is a nefarious operation, gets hacked, etc. and the individual, like a <a title="avoid private investigator" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/08/avoid-private-investigators/" target="_blank">private investigator who should be avoided</a>, who has access to your password then uses <a title="transactional databases" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/transactional-databases-what-me-worry/" target="_blank">transactional databases</a> to get your background information then you could be very vulnerable and perhaps become the subject of <a title="fraudulent identification documents" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/06/fraudulent-identification-documents/" target="_blank">fraudulent identity documents</a>. Use a <a title="hawala system" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/09/modern-hawala/" target="_blank">hawala system</a> for even greater privacy of financial transactions.  Once they are able to do that then they will have access to anything about you that is online. This breach of your personal privacy could lead to problems with your bank accounts, credit cards or brokerage accounts.</p>
<p>And even worse it can allow identity theft to take place on a massive scale. Identity theft will like cause major problems with your financial data and situation for months. So to be safe, the best thing for you to do, is to make sure you use a different password on every site. If you want to make it easier then you can use the same password on sites that are not important.</p>
<p>But you will have to remember to never use that password on any important sites. Important sites usually involve those of a financial or personal nature.  If you do not want the public to know about it then do not use the same password.</p>
<p>To avoid any problems, you should keep your passwords within encrypted software that you have to use a master password to access. This way, even if someone is able to get into your computer, they will not be able to get the passwords because they are encrypted. And it should be easy for you to remember the master password to get in the software. This will make your web surfing much secure for your personal information.</p>
<p>There are several programs available but they usually range from $30-50 each and vary depending on your operating system.  I have found the free encryption software <a title="true crypt" href="http://www.truecrypt.org" target="_blank">True Crypt</a> to be perfect for my needs because I do not have a significant amount of important usernames and passwords that need to be stored to <a title="protect your computer" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/01/how-to-protect-your-computer/" target="_blank">protect your computer</a>.  If you want to create a comprehensive plan for protecting your privacy, get the book <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/HTVBook">How To Vanish</a>.</p>
