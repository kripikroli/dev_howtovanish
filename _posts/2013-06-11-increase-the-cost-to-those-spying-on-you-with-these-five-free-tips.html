<p>They copied and stored all your emails, phone calls and texts? <em>You had no idea.</em></p>
<p>They <a title="survive in captivity" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/how-to-survive-in-captivity/" target="_blank">jacked your device's memory and bandwidth to report back with your personal information</a> without a single thought to how you would feel? <em>Insensitive pricks.</em></p>
<p>They violated your conversations with your wife or girlfriend and then surreptitiously used your own electronic devices to <a title="sue tsa" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/do-you-need-to-sue-a-tsa-agent/" target="_blank">take naked pictures of them</a>. <em>Probably failed to even use a rubber.</em></p>
<p>Now they front-run you in the stock market because they know earnings in advance because of your credit card purchases. <em>Bastards!</em></p>
<p><strong>YOU ARE GETTING SPIED ON</strong></p>
<p>Information is power. The ability to breach someone's secrets is another power. The ability to breach someone's secrets without their knowledge is a greater power still.</p>
<p>As the patriot-hero <em>Edward Snowden's</em> massive leak has shown is that the United Stasi of America is doing what we have <a title="long warned people against" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/privacy-tools-and-resources/" target="_blank">long warned people against</a>: collecting every email, text message, phone call, Internet visit, credit card purchase, Facebook post, cell phone location and so much more along with organizing these into dossiers which are permanently databased, archived and searchable forever.</p>
<p><strong>FIVE FREE TIPS FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO TO RAISE THE COST OF BEING SPIED ON</strong></p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, be aware you are being spied on and cognizant of some ways you leak <a title="personal information on the Internet" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/02/remove-personal-information-from-the-internet/" target="_blank">personal information on the Internet</a> and how to clean it up.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you should already be using a <a title="vpn and bitcoin" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/08/anonymous-web-surfing/" target="_blank">VPN and Bitcoin</a> so employ these principles and tactics to shift purchasing power to merchants that accept Bitcoin. Do not let firms like <a title="stratfor compromise your personal information" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/12/stratfor-failed-to-protect-their-customers-by-not-accepting-bitcoin/" target="_blank">Stratfor compromise your personal information</a> and render you increasingly vulnerable to identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, <a title="opt out unsolicited credit card offers" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/09/opt-out-make-prequalified-offers-for-credit-cards-stop/" target="_blank">opt-out of unsolicited credit card offers</a>. Get off their databases and away from these tracking devices. The borrower is servant to the lender, you are <a title="chained and naked with loan privacy disclosures" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/08/chained-and-naked/" target="_blank">chained and naked with loan privacy disclosures</a>, so avoid debt like you would avoid the plague.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, sign-up for the free How To Vanish email list and get the Free Privacy Guide. It has some extremely helpful and free tips for you to follow. Plus, you will get more tips on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Remember, spying costs money. Sure, they can print money out of thin air but eventually that privilege will come to an end. And with Bitcoin around that is likely to be sooner than before. Remember, using USD, EUR, Bitcoin, etc. is a political choice so opt for <a title="political privacy" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/06/laws-protecting-political-privacy/" target="_blank">political privacy</a>.</p>
<p>But even more than costing money it costs human resources to make any sense out of all the data. And the more human resources you can tie up following worthless and ineffectual trails the better. The more people who do this the higher the cost of spying <b><i>exponentially</i></b> rises while the return on investment, actionable or useful intelligence, gets lower and lower.</p>
<p>But why just stop with you taking control of your privacy?</p>
<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, understand the force multiplier effect of encryption and share this post with your friends. Spark a discussion and show each other privacy protecting techniques. Plus, it is fun introducing James Bond techniques into your life. Delude yourself and pretend that you actually matter enough to someone else to be spied on.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As Mr. Snowden's efforts have shown; the State is working to obliterate your privacy. They want you naked in a petri dish. You must pro-actively work to protect your privacy. You must actually do something.</p>
<p>But you are not alone. <a title="howovanish" href="http://www.howtovanish.com" target="_blank">How To Vanish</a> was created to help you by providing you with tools, tips, strategies and techniques to take control of your privacy and an easy way to share those with your friends. So get started having some fun!</p>
