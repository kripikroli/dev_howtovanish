title: 'SAR Report Awareness: No More Transaction Reports'

<p>The <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/Matrix">Matrix </a>grows larger and stronger with every <a title="SAR Report" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/06/sar-report-awareness-no-more-transaction-reports/" target="_blank">SAR Report</a> (Suspicious Activity Report), Currency Transaction Report, bank transaction and everything else in the <a title="Transactional Database" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/transactional-databases-what-me-worry/" target="_blank">transactional databases</a>.<br /><br />  How To Vanish is partly about how to unplug from the Matrix.  The Matrix needs you to feed it.  It knows where you are and what you do.  If it doesn't like you it can cut you off and shut you down.  Neo escaped, not just by <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/IdentityCloaker">anonymous web surfing</a>, but by unplugging from the Matrix and then controlling how and when he entered.  He did not have to avoid it completely, and neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>SAR Reports, Currency Transaction Reports, Transactional Databases</strong></p>
<p>One way to control when you enter the Matrix is to transact anonymously with gold and silver.  There are very few monetary transactions that are completely anonymous.  Using plastic cards leaves a trail in transactional databases for the Matrix to find and involves a lot of third parties.<br /><br />  So does writing a check.  Cash is usually very good for protecting privacy in transactions, but even <a title="Use Cash" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/10/the-sweet-sound-of-cash/" target="_blank">cash</a> is subject to SAR Report requirements, Currency Transaction Reports, Currency Controls and other restrictions.  More detailed information about these regulations is found in the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/bankprivacyreport1">Bank Privacy Report</a>.  As inflation rages on, the SAR Report and Currency Transaction Reporting requirements will likely creep into more and more common transactions, thus feeding the Matrix.  Using gold or silver in your transactions instead of using the traditional cash, credit and <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/PrepaidDebitCards">debit cards</a> or checks is one of the best ways to protect the anonymity of any transaction and escape the Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Gold and Silver</strong></p>
<p>Gold and silver can be traded in many forms.  Bullion bars, coins, digital accounts and other methods have made transacting in gold and silver easy.  Digital gold transactions could form part of a strong overall strategy, but they leave an electronic audit trail which the Matrix can follow so I will leave the usefulness of digital gold for another day.<br /><br /> Large quantities of gold and silver, such as bullion bars, can be used for very large transactions but bullion benefits from remaining within the official chain of custody.    Plus, the size of such transactions means the individuals will probably be dealing in something that has other transaction reporting requirements anyways, so the SAR Report and Currency Transaction Reports would not really expand the Matrix in this context anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Using Gold and Silver Coins to Disconnect From The Matrix</strong></p>
<p>Coins come in all kinds of sizes and are a standardized form of currency in most of the world.  They usually do not have any unique identifiers, such as a serial number, which would permit them to be tracked.  Even if they had unique identifiers, they could easily be melted and the metal sold by weight and still retain most of its value.</p>

<p><strong>Beating The Matrix At Its Own Game</strong></p>
<p>Neo was the chosen one and mastered the rules of the Matrix, eventually beating it at its own game.  There is an added benefit that US law provides when dealing with gold and silver coins.  Some gold and silver coins are legal tender in the US.  Their legal tender face value is significantly less than the intrinsic value of the underlying metal. For example, a 1 ounce gold eagle coin has a face value of $50. <br /><br /> The value of the metal in the coin is worth well over $1,000.  If you pay an independent contractor to do your landscaping in cash, and you pay him more than $10,000 during the year, you will be subject to a transaction report.  If, however, you pay him 10 gold coins, a total currency value of $500, you deny the Matrix of that information because you will probably not be subject to the same reporting requirements.  Some have begun to beat the Matrix and take advantage of this arbitrage.  The law is not resolved in this area so I would discuss with legal counsel before making any transactions which take advantage of this arbitrage.</p>
<p><strong>Sovereign Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Gold itself is not controlled in any way by any other individual, entity or government.  This makes it completely free of any encumbrance.  Encumbrances hinder privacy. Thus using gold in your transactions is the most private way to exchange anything.</p>
<p><strong>Give Me The Pill Morpheus</strong></p>
<p>Where do I find this blue pill so that I can start doing things off the grid of the Matrix?  In other words, how do I get physical gold and silver coins to start transacting with gold?  There are local coin dealers in a lot of places who can sell you legal tender gold coins.  Local dealers might be subject to some limitations, for example they may not be able to take advantage of economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Good Coin Dealer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/BuyGoldCoins">Reputable online dealers</a> allow you to take delivery of coins in most places around the country and don't require you to appear in person. Ordering gold coins online will leave a record, but once you have possession of this gold, it is more anonymous than cash.  Once you have begun purchasing coins from these <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/BuyGoldCoins">dealers</a>, find others that you regularly deal with who will accept gold and silver coins as payment.  Advertise that you accept gold and silver coins yourself.  In my law practice and because of '<em>this economy</em>', <br /><br />I am happy to accept payment from clients in many different forms including all kinds of gold and silver, both legal tender and not.  If you find it hard to do this directly, look for ways to use <a title="Hawala" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/09/modern-hawala/" target="_blank">hawala</a> transactions to complete payment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>SAR Reports, Currency Transaction Reports and other currency controls can destroy the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/bankprivacyreport1">privacy and anonymity of financial transactions</a>, even those <a title="Use Cash" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/10/the-sweet-sound-of-cash/" target="_blank">using cash</a>. Even <a title="anonymous browsing" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/should-i-pay-for-anonymous-web-surfing/" target="_blank">anonymous browsing</a> cannot prevent the requirement to record your transactions.  If you might be subject to those kinds of transaction reports, you may consider using <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/BuyGoldCoins">legal tender gold and silver coins</a> to unplug yourself from the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/Matrix">Matrix</a>.  It is your choice, you can read <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/HTVBook">How To Vanish</a>, swallow the blue pill and follow me, or you can take the red pill and go back to the way things were.</p>
