<p>How far would you go to avoid being sexually assaulted or having to dance naked in front of strangers?  <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/RosaParks" target="_blank">Boycotts</a> have proven to be very effective at crippling immoral and corrupt government policies and practices.  It might be effective to <a title="boycott TSA" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/how-to-boycott-tsa/" target="_blank">Boycott TSA</a> in addition to <a title="sue tsa" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/do-you-need-to-sue-a-tsa-agent/" target="_blank">suing TSA agents</a> in their individual capacity.</p>
<p>Many Americans are flying less and others are refusing to fly since the TSA has implemented "security measures" that would be laughable if they weren't so sadistic.  But the US is very isolated from most of the world by some very large and very wet oceans.  There is no Chunnel from New York to London. There is a way to participate in a boycott of TSA and still travel by air internationally without having to undergo dehumanizing searches of your private parts.</p>

<h2>Fly Out Of Mexico Or Canada</h2>
<p>Air travelers flying within Mexico or Canada do not have to undergo the same invasive security procedures as air travelers in the US.  Mexico and Canada still have security measures, but they are much more polite, much more effective and don't go as far to violate basic human dignity.  You can use this difference to your advantage.  Boycott TSA by driving to a foreign airport for international flights.  Just make sure that your flight is not routed through the US.</p>
<h2>A Foreign Airport Might Be Closer Than You Think</h2>
<p>About 40 million Americans live within 200 miles of a major airport in either Mexico or Canada.  That means it is only a short drive or train ride to avoid making pornographic images of your body or having your genitals touched.</p>

<h2>Avoid Connecting In The US</h2>
<p>Many of these international airports are very large and will be hubs for international travel anyway.  From others, you can easily route through other major cities, like Mexico City, to reach your foreign destination.  If you are traveling to Central or South America, it might even be cheaper to depart from Tijuana than it would be to depart from LAX, John Wayne, Ontario, San Diego, Burbank or other US airports.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dr. Martin Luther King helped overcome immoral legal barriers by boycotting the local transportation system.  The economic strain from the loss of revenue contributed significantly to overcoming those barriers. The same kind of boycott of the airlines today could have a similar effect.  The ever-struggling airlines have already lost billions because of immoral "security measures."  Flying out of Mexico or Canada is how you can participate in the TSA boycott and still get where you need to go.  Get <a title="Privacy Book" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/how-to-vanish-book/" target="_blank">How To Vanish the book</a> to find other legal ways to boycott invasive and immoral privacy invasions.</p>
