<p>How To Vanish is intended to help you keep personal and financial secrets using the best practices in compliance with law.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/why-start-howtovanish.jpg" alt="why start howtovanish" width="520" height="88" /></strong></p>
<p>Without the ability to keep secrets, individuals lose the capacity to distinguish themselves from others, to maintain independent lives, to be complete and autonomous persons. This does not mean that a person actually has to keep secrets to be autonomous, just that she must possess the ability to do so. The ability to keep secrets implies the ability to disclose secrets selectively, and so the capacity for selective disclosure at one’s own discretion is important to individual autonomy as well.</p>
<p>Secrecy is a form of power. The ability to protect a secret, to preserve one’s privacy, is a form of power. The ability to penetrate secrets, to learn them, to use them, is also a form of power. Secrecy empowers, secrecy protects, secrecy hurts. The ability to learn a person’s secrets without his or her knowledge — to pierce a person’s privacy in secret — is a greater power still.</p>
<p>We want to help you exercise your unalienable right to secrecy, or in other words, to have you and your property left alone.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/trace-mayer-200x200.jpg" alt="trace mayer" width="200" height="200" />Lohengrin</strong> has helped many people profit by demonstrating a significant documented foresight and prognostication ability in the money, currency and payment markets and developments. He has earned degrees in accounting and law and has studied the Austrian school of economics.</p>
<p>He is an ardent defender and advocate of the freedom of speech and a member of the Society of Professional Journalists.</p>
<p>[leadplayer_vid id="534D2A8440582"]</p>
<p>He was among the first popular bloggers to publicly recommend Bitcoin in its infancy with a market cap under $2m and well before its massive rise to about $12B in November 2013. He has presented on Bitcoin, both objectively and persuasively, to a wide variety of audiences including members of the Federal Reserve, Bundesbank, major financial institutions, HNWIs, conferences and many others.</p>
<p>So if you use or like Bitcoin then there is a good chance it is because you or someone who influenced you (like <a title="robert wenzel economic policy journal bitcoins" href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/10/this-week-on-robert-wenzel-show.html" target="_blank">Robert Wenzel of Economic Policy Journal</a>, <a title="gata accepts bitcoins" href="http://www.gata.org/node/12105" target="_blank">Chris Powell of GATA</a>, <a title="lewrockwell bitcoins" href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/donate/" target="_blank">Lew Rockwell</a>, <a title="anti-war" href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/11/27/an-alternative-way-to-help-antiwar-com/" target="_blank">Anti-War.com</a>, <a title="jeff berwick bitcoins" href="http://anarchast.com/front/2012/11/5/anarchast-ep-46-the-crypto-revolution-featuring-trace-mayer.html" target="_blank">Jeff Berwick of The Dollar Vigilante</a>, <a title="silver vigilante" href="http://silvervigilante.com/sv-interviews-trace-mayer/" target="_blank">The Silver Vigilante</a>, John Rubino of <a title="dollar collapse" href="http://www.dollarcollapse.com" target="_blank">Dollar Collapse</a>, <a title="jason burack wall street for main street" href="http://podcast.runtogold.com/2012/12/rtg-94-2012-11-02/" target="_blank">Jason Burack of Wall Street For Main Street</a>, <a title="brotherjohnf" href="http://www.brotherjohnf.com/archives/89358" target="_blank">BrotherJohnF</a>, Michael of <a title="the daily paul bitcoin" href="http://www.dailypaul.com/264392/why-bitcoin-acceptance-should-be-a-litmus-test-of-liberty-proponents" target="_blank">The Daily Paul</a>, <a title="max keiser" href="http://maxkeiser.com/2012/09/16/understanding-bitcoin-security-trace-mayer-interviewed-visionvictory/" target="_blank">Max Keiser</a>, <a title="james turk bitcoin" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPazVjb0OpQ#t=24m50s" target="_blank">James Turk of GoldMoney</a>, <a title="kerry lutz financial survival network bitcoins" href="http://podcast.runtogold.com/2013/01/rtg-95-2013-01-11/" target="_blank">Kerry Lutz of the Financial Survival Network</a> and <a title="future money trends bitcoins" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2012/09/a-pretty-good-bitcoin-interview/" target="_blank">Daniel Ameduri of Future Money Trends</a>) were, as a result of his work, <a title="persuade accept bitcoins" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/09/why-bitcoin-acceptance-should-be-a-bellweather-of-liberty-proponents/" target="_blank">all influenced early on and persuaded to use and accept bitcoins</a>.</p>
